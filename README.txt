This is a library that has been modified from the Adafruit CAP1188 Library for the CAP1188 8-channel Capacitive touch sensor

Designed specifically to work with the CAP1188 Breakout and the Adafruit Trinket available in the Adafruit shop 
  ----> https://www.adafruit.com/products/



This library is meant to work over I2C only. Connect the CAP1188 SDA to Trinket Pin #0, CAP1188 SCK to Trinket Pin #2 and CAP1188 RST to Trinket Pin #1.
